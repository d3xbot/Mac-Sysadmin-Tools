# Mac-Sysadmin-Tools
Scripts I've written to make Mac administration and cleanup a bit easier. Note: Some scripts are Jamf-specific, but others are fairly universal

I'm not a very experienced dev, but I'm learning as I go! I'm happy for *constructive* criticism, ideas for improvement, and general advice. Issues and PRs are open to any admins who would like to contribute.

### TODO
 - [x] Post Adobe / Office VisualBasic Runtime Error script
 - [ ] Post Cisco VPN Client full uninstall script
 - [ ] Post "Kill Legacy Screensaver" "script"
 - [ ] Come up with more scripts
