# Style guide
I believe in consistent style.

## Markdown
GitHub Flavored Markdown preferred - that should be a given, since we're here on GitHub :)

## Shell Code
We indent with tabs in this here repo. If you prefer spaces, please use a tool like Sublime Text to convert Space indentation to Tab indentation.

Standard indentation rules for shell code apply. Comments and code are left-aligned with tabs for loop contents, multi-line wraps, case statements, etc.

No line width maximum. I won't hold you to 80 columns or anything. Soft-wrap exists and I take advantage of it here. If you do prefer to stick to an arbitrary max line width, please ensure that your subsequent lines are appropriately indented.

## Everything else
uhhhhh I'll burn that bridge when we get to it
